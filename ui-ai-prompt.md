# UI Design Prompt for PT. Putra Pile Indah

Create a responsive web interface for "PT. Putra Pile Indah"—a modern construction materials company specializing in pile solutions. The site should feel premium and trustworthy, using a clean sans-serif typography system, balanced white space, and a soft palette combining deep navy (#0d1b2a), muted teal (#1b4965), warm gray (#f0f0f0), and copper accents (#d97706). Support both light and dark themes with a smooth toggle.

Key sections to design:

1. **Navbar** with a glassmorphism/liquid effect, left-aligned logo, centered navigation, right-aligned actions (theme toggle, contact button). Preserve readability over rich background imagery.
2. **Hero** area featuring layered hero cards revealing on scroll (GSAP-style animation). Include headline, supporting text, two primary CTAs ("View Products" and "Contact Sales"), and a background collage hinting at industrial construction scenes.
3. **Capabilities** grid describing core strengths (Engineering Expertise, Sustainable Materials, Advanced Logistics). Each tile should show iconography, short description, and hover elevation.
4. **Benefits** dual-column layout mixing copy and imagery, emphasizing speed, compliance, and customization.
5. **Products** carousel highlighting product lines (Hi Pile, Boa, Polyester, Customization). Use card-based slides with product imagery, specs, and "Request Quote" buttons.
6. **Product Overview** walkthrough cards that stack/overlap with subtle drop shadows, illustrating the lifecycle (Design → Fabrication → Delivery → Installation).
7. **Export Markets** section with an interactive world map highlighting regions (Southeast Asia, Middle East, Europe). Use animated arcs or pulses.
8. **Customers** marquee displaying grayscale client logos that shift to full color on hover.
9. **Contact** form with name, email, phone, and project details, plus a secondary card listing headquarters info and social links.
10. **FAQ** accordion with smooth open/close transitions and clear typography.
11. **Footer** containing quick links, company mission blurb, and copyright.

Additional requirements:

- Maintain consistent spacing (8px baseline grid) and accessible contrast ratios.
- Showcase CMS-editable content blocks with editable indicators (small "CMS" badges) to hint at a headless CMS integration.
- Include admin dashboard glimpse: sidebar navigation, content editors, drag-and-drop upload zone, and admin token input field.
- Ensure design scales beautifully from mobile to desktop; include mobile-first wireframe callouts.
- Provide component callouts for shadcn/ui-inspired elements (buttons, cards, accordions, navigation menu) and note Tailwind utility usage.

Deliverables: a cohesive UI concept board or high-fidelity mockups that follow the above structure, annotated with reasoning for key layout and interaction choices.
